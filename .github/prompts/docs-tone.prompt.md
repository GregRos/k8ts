In your task, you will be asked to write documentation.

PREFER a mix of technical jargon and simple, accessible connective prose.
PREFER active voice versus passive voice descriptions or noun phrases. E.g. "encapsulates" not "is an encapsulation of"
PREFER Multiple `#` h1 headings in a document to reduce the overall nesting complexity. The first h1 is understood to be the heading of the entire document.
ALWAYS put a bit of text after a heading, even if it's a few words.
AVOID repetition. If you've said something once, you don't need to do it twice.
AVOID numbered headings.
PREFER accessible language, clear communication
AVOID formal or elaborate prose.

When writing on a specific topic, simplify other topics.

When writing documentation, always write it as markdown and write it to `.ai/outputs/`.
